**Shuffle and Play Blackjack**
You are tasked with creating a C or C++ program to simulate a game of blackjack. You must use pointers and arrays to manage the deck of cards and player hands.
## Part 1: Shuffling the Deck
1. Initialize an array to represent a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Each card can be represented as a structure with fields for suit and rank.
2. Create a function that shuffles the deck using a pointer-based algorithm. The deck should be thoroughly shuffled.
## Part 2: Playing Blackjack
3. Create functions to deal two initial cards to the player and the dealer.
4. Implement the rules of blackjack, including card values (number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10, and aces can be 1 or 11).
5. Allow the player to hit or stand. Use pointers to manage the player's hand.
6. Implement the dealer's logic to hit until the dealer's hand value is at least 17.
7. Determine the winner based on standard blackjack rules.
